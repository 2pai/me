### Retrospective [2020]
If I can describe 2020 with a word, it would be "rollercoaster".

By the end of 2019, I tweeted my goal in 2020 and think that next year will be going well as I was expected. But, we know that pandemic hit us, a lot of my plans didn't go well.

January 2020, I attended Global Diversity CFP day in Jakarta. Simply was to learn "how to became a speaker in tech conference"; one of my attempts to make my dreams come true. I've learned a lot of things during this event, things that I need to achieve my goals. a month later, I've been asked to organize the same event in Bandung and it was fun. I think it was my safe place to learn and do mistake before I prepared for the real talks.

Apr 2020, I've been asked by mas giri to be a speaker on Cloudnative ID online meetup. I know, it was just an online meetup (since the pandemic hit us) and maybe it sounds easy; But, since that was my first time being a speaker and it makes me very nervous. I even didn't turn on my webcam üòÇ. After my first talk, I realize that I really enjoyed sharing my knowledge with other people and it forces me to learn more & more again; also to deeply understand the topics that I bring to the talks (which is good for my personal growth). The total was 5 talks that I've been done in 2020 (it was a huge number)

Also in Apr 2020, I started to publish my first video about coding on youtube. That was my first step to accomplish one of my goals in 2020, to make more publications on another platform (medium). I never expected that my videos were helping a lot of people, the comment/feedback that I receive pushed me to learn new things every day, it also became one of my stress relief to make my mind still sane during a pandemic. In total, I made 13 videos and gains 700 subscribers.

Aug 2020, I started working as a DevOps Engineer Intern at Pintu Indonesia & Rupiah Token. I've been learning a lot from this period, not only learn about how to use A-Z tools; but understanding the fundamental things, learn to decide the tech stack to make our system reliable (not because of the hype). I also gain direct mentorship from my seniors & VP Engineer, it was a privilege for being guided to the right path for my future careers and having someone to validate my knowledge. In December, my internship program was over but I've been extended to be a part-time employee ( Again, thanks to my seniors & HR üôè )

On the other side, this year I decided to stop communicating with her. it was a hard decision for me, Since she was the person that accompanied me in 2019 and she was the person that I've always waiting to meet with. We've been going through a lot of problems, obstacles, etc together and it makes us grow. But in the end, we're not on the same path again and life must go on.

```
Let us be thankful and take in all the mistakes we have done to better ourselves for 2021. Remember that the best thing you can do for your own personal growth is to be truthful with yourselves and vulnerable acknowledge your own mistakes and utilize them to power your own transformation in 2021
